# # SymPy example for Structural Mechanics problems 

# With SymPy, a very powerfull computer algebra tool, mechanics problems can be solved in an easy and fast way. It will take over the cumbersome handcalculations. However the engineering part; the thinking, the modelling and the correct input of the specifications still remains a human matter. 
# A simple beam is taken as an example. The beam is loaded with a uniform load `q` on a part of the beam and a force `F`. All loads are considered to be static loads. The beam is a prismatic beam with a bending stiffness `EI`.
# 
# ![figuur 3](data/Data_SymPy_example_for_Structural_Mechanics_problems/Beam.gif)
# 
# With SymPy the beam deflections and the moment and shear distribution along the beam axis will be computed. The model used is the beam-model which can be discribed with the fourth order differential equation (DE):
# 
# $EI{{{d^4}w} \over {d{x^4}}} = q\left( x \right)$
# 
# The solution of the problem can only be found with the correct boundary conditions. In this simple case the four required boundary conditions are: 
# - $w(0)=0$
# - $M(0)=0$
# - $w(L)=0$
# - $M(L)=0$
# 
# The DE is only valid for domains were the load distibution is continuous differentiable. If the problem is worked out by hand we should have to split the problem in to three domains. Each discontinuity in the loading or the beamproperties urges for a split. Each domain requires four boundary conditions. This would result in 12 boundary conditions. Four of these conditions 
# are specified on the outer boundaries of the problem, the other eight are specified on the two connections between the three domains. If we solve this problem with SymPy (see [Alternative implementation](#3_ODE) ) however this approach is not necessary. If the load can be specified as one continous differentiable function along the total beam axis we can model the beam as one domain.
# How can we describe the load as one function which is valid for the total beam length? The uniform load `q` can be modelled with a `sympy.Heaviside` function (step function, see Calculus page 49 and 95) and the force `F` can be modelled with a `sympy.DiracDelta` or Î´-function. Both functions can be found in the standard mathematics text books or in the help of SymPy.
# 
# In SymPy the modelling of the load looks like this (the 35 kN is not visible in the plot):

# In the plot of the load function `q` the force `F` is not visible. However the load exists, this can 
# seen by calculating the total load with the integral of the load function.

# The results of the calculation can best be viewed with a plot.

# ## Alternative implementation with Singularity Functions

# As you may have noticed, the evaluation of the result of the `Heaviside` and `DiracDelta` function takes a while. An alternative implementation is to make use of the `SingularityFunction`, which evaluates down to the `Heaviside` function for $n = 0$ and the `DiracDelta` function for $n=1$:
# $$\matrix{
#    n & {{{\langle x - a\rangle }^n}} & {{\text{Physical meaning}}}  \cr 
#    { - 2} & {{\kern 1pt} {d \over {dx}}\delta \left( {x - a} \right){\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} } & {{\text{Unit moment at }}x = a}  \cr 
#    { - 1} & {\delta \left( {x - a} \right)} & {{\text{Unit force at }}x = a}  \cr 
#    0 & {H\left( {x - a} \right){\kern 1pt} } & {{\text{Start distributed load at }}x = a}  \cr 
#    1 & {\left( {x - a} \right)H\left( {x - a} \right){\kern 1pt} } & {{\text{Start linear distributed load at }}x = a}  \cr 
#    { > 0} & {{{\left( {x - a} \right)}^n}H\left( {x - a} \right)} & {{\text{Start polynomial at }}x = a}  \cr } $$
# 
# These functions are easily integrated according to the following rules:
# $$\int {{{\left\langle {x - a} \right\rangle }^n}dx}  = \left\{ {\matrix{
#    {{{\left\langle {x - a} \right\rangle }^{n + 1}}} & {{\text{if }}n < 0}  \cr 
#    {{{{{\left\langle {x - a} \right\rangle }^{n + 1}}} \over {n + 1}}} & {{\text{if }}n \ge 0}  \cr  } } \right.$$
